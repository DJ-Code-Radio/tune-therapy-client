## IN Scope - What our product will do:

- Stimulate the user via visual and audio media
- Provide an opportunity for the user to interact with media by choosing their preferred media
- Provide the user an opportunity to consider their feelings and mood and select "vibes" that align
- Expose the user to new music or music which could be pleasing to them in their current mood.

## OUT of scope - What our product will not do:

Medically treat the user's health or mood issues

## Our MVP functionality will be:

* the user will understand the site and be invited to the listening room experience
* the user will choose a visual representation (image) that corresponds to a mood they are currently in or want to experience
* the site will recommend a song for the listener to enjoy based off of the emotion the user selected
* the user will then be able to listen to a song that is the result of their selection 
* the recommended playlist is saved in the user Spotify account

## Our stretch goals will be:

* the user's original choice of image will be their listening room environment background
* user shares feedback on songs they are presented on the playlist in the listening room
* user's feedback on songs can be used to recommend songs in the next user session or to interact with the user giving personalized interaction or choices for music on the next user session
