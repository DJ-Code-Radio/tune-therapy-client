# Software Requirements

## Vision:

User experiences a movie room based on media selections they are feeling aligned with.
Pain point this project solves:

The monotonous movie search.
Care about this product because:

As much time can be spent looking for one to watch as watching. CineMood allows the user to receive a movie recommendation based off the genre they choose and their current mood. Movies can not only entertain us, but they can also move us and influence our lives. 


## IN Scope - What our product will do:

- Provide an opportunity for the user to interact with movies by choosing their preferred genre and mood.
- Suggest a movie to the user which could be pleasing to them in their current mood.
- Create an AI generated theater image for the user based on the mood they select. 

## OUT of scope - What our product will not do:

Guarantee a movie recommendation that is new to the user.

## Our MVP functionality will be:

* the user will understand the site and be invited to the movie room experience
* the site will recommend a movie for the user to enjoy based off of the emotion and genre the user selected
* the user will then be able to watch a trailer to a movie that is the result of the AI generated recommendation 

## Our stretch goals will be:

* the user's original choice of mood will be used to create an image that will be their movie room environment background
* user shares feedback on the movie recommendation they are presented
* user's feedback on movies can be used to recommend movies in the next user session or to interact with the user giving personalized interaction or choices for moives on the next user session
